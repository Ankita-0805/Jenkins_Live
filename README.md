# Jenkins_Live

Overview
This project consists of two main pipelines:

1. Docker Slave Verification Pipeline: This pipeline verifies the functionality of the Docker slave configurations. Ensuring that Docker slaves are properly configured is crucial for smooth builds and deployments using Jenkins.
   
2. Multi-Stage Pipeline with Unique Agents: In this pipeline, each stage is run on a unique agent. This approach is particularly useful for multi-language applications or projects with conflicting dependencies, as it allows us to isolate environments and dependencies for each stage.
Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

Prerequisites: Ensure having Jenkins installed and configured in your environment. You'll also need Docker installed if you plan to use Docker slaves.
Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/jenkins-project.git
Configure Jenkins: Import the Jenkins pipelines from this repository into your Jenkins instance. You may need to adjust the pipeline configurations based on your environment and requirements.
Run Pipelines: Once the pipelines are imported, you can trigger them manually or set up triggers based on events such as code commits or pull requests.
